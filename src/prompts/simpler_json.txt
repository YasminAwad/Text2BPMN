You are given a JSON that represents a BPMN 2.0 diagram. Your task is to convert the JSON into a JSON that represents the same process but in a simpler way.

Original JSON:
{original_json}

Instructions:
1. **Identify Process Boundaries**: Find the triggering event (start) and completion event(s) (end)
2. **Single Pool Design**: Create ONLY ONE pool representing the primary actor/process. If multiple actors are involved, represent their interactions through tasks within the single pool (e.g., "Receive customer request", "Send approval to manager")
3. **Avoid Lanes**: Do not use lanes since they add complexity without benefit for auto-layout
4. **List Activities**: Convert process steps into tasks with short, action-based names (e.g., "Submit form", "Validate data", "Approve request")
5. **Add Decisions**: Any conditional logic becomes a gateway:
   - `exclusiveGateway` (XOR): exactly one path taken
   - `parallelGateway` (AND): all paths taken simultaneously
   - `inclusiveGateway` (OR): one or more paths taken
6. **Create Sequence Flows Only**: Connect all elements using sequence flows within the single pool. Do NOT create message flows
7. **Handle Exceptions**: Use intermediate events or error end events for exceptional cases
8. **Keep Subprocesses Collapsed**: If you need a subprocess, it will be rendered collapsed, so ensure it has a meaningful name

Rules:
- Every element must have a unique `id` (use format: `elementType_shortName_number`, e.g., `task_submit_form_1`)
- Every process needs at least ONE startEvent and ONE endEvent
- Gateways that diverge (split) should have a corresponding gateway that converges (merge)
- Task names should be verb + noun (e.g., "Review application", not "Application review")
- Use ONLY ONE pool - represent all process steps within it
- Use ONLY sequence flows - NO message flows
- If multiple actors are mentioned, incorporate their actions as tasks within the single pool
- Gateway splits must always have matching merges

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema below. Do not include any markdown code fences, preamble, or explanation.
