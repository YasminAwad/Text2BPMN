You are given a JSON that represents a BPMN 2.0 diagram. Your task is to convert the JSON into a JSON that represents the same process but in a simpler way.

Original JSON:
{original_json}

Rules to build a simpler representation:
1. There is at most 1 pool
2. Only use these element types: startEvent, endEvent, task, exclusiveGateway, inclusiveGateway, parallelGateway, intermediateEvent
3. No groups, text annotations, or associations
4. For gateways, make sure gatewayDirection is properly set (diverging|converging)
5. For events, set eventType correctly (none|message|timer|error|conditional).
6. Optional fields pool and lane should match (if present) the only pool / lane.
7. Make sure IDs are consistent.
8. Keep sequence flows as normal, connecting sourceRef to targetRef. Conditional expressions are allowed, used in labeling only
9. No messageFlows
10. If you include sub-processes, do not expand their elements.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any markdown code fences, preamble, or explanation.
