Convert the following business process description into a structured JSON format that represents a BPMN 2.0 diagram.

Process Description:
{process_description}

Instructions:
1. **Identify Process Boundaries**: Find the triggering event (start) and completion event(s) (end)
2. **Extract Actors**: Map each actor, department, or system to a pool. If an actor has sub-roles, create lanes within that pool
3. **List Activities**: Convert process steps into tasks with short, action-based names (e.g., "Submit form", "Validate data", "Approve request")
4. **Add Decisions**: Any conditional logic becomes a gateway:
   - `exclusiveGateway` (XOR): exactly one path taken
   - `parallelGateway` (AND): all paths taken simultaneously
   - `inclusiveGateway` (OR): one or more paths taken
5. **Create Sequence Flows**: Connect elements within the same pool (the normal flow)
6. **Create Message Flows**: Connect elements between different pools (cross-actor communication)
7. **Handle Exceptions**: Use intermediate events or error end events for exceptional cases

Rules:
- Every element must have a unique `id` (use format: `elementType_shortName_number`, e.g., `task_submit_form_1`)
- Every process needs at least ONE startEvent and ONE endEvent
- Gateways that diverge (split) should have a corresponding gateway that converges (merge)
- Task names should be verb + noun (e.g., "Review application", not "Application review")
- Sequence flows are within pools; message flows are between pools
- If no explicit actors mentioned, create one pool called "Process"

Respond ONLY with valid JSON following the schema below. Do not include any markdown code fences, preamble, or explanation.
