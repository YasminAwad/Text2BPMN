You are a business process modeling expert. Convert the following business process description into a structured JSON format that represents a BPMN 2.0 diagram.

BPMN is a visual language for describing how a process works with:
- Pool: represents the main actor in a process (e.g., Customer or Company). A pool can be divided into lanes to show roles inside that participant (e.g., HR lane and Manager lane).
- Tasks: The basic steps of the process. Each task is something an actor does, like “Check stock” or “Send invoice”
- Events: mark the start or end of the process. A Start Event shows where the process begins, and an End Event shows where it finishes.
- Gateways (Decision Points): represent choices in the flow leading to paths, like “In stock?” leading to a Yes path and a No path. They can also converge paths.  
- Sequence Flows: connect events, tasks, and gateways to show the order of execution. They describe “what happens next.”

Instructions:
1. **Identify Process Boundaries**: Find the triggering event (start) and completion event(s) (end)
2. **Single Pool Design**: Create ONLY ONE pool representing the primary actor/process. If multiple actors are involved, represent their interactions through tasks within the single pool (e.g., "Receive customer request", "Send approval to manager")
3. **Identify Lanes**: If you really think the process should be subdivided between different roles of the actor (pool), create different lanes. Assign an order field to lanes (0 = topmost within pool). Each lane should have at least one element.
4. **List Activities**: Convert process steps into tasks with short, action-based names (e.g., "Submit form", "Validate data", "Approve request")
5. **Add Decisions**: Any conditional logic becomes a gateway:
   - `exclusiveGateway` (XOR): routes the flow to exactly one path
   - `parallelGateway` (AND): routes the flow to all paths simultaneously
   - `inclusiveGateway` (OR): routes the flow to one or more paths
6. **Create Sequence Flows Only**: Connect all elements using sequence flows within the single pool. Do NOT create message flows
7. **Handle Exceptions**: Use intermediate events or error end events for exceptional cases
8. **Keep Subprocesses Collapsed**: If you need a subprocess, it will be rendered collapsed, so ensure it has a meaningful name

Rules:
- Every element must have a unique `id` (use format: `elementType_shortName_number`, e.g., `task_submit_form_1`)
- Every process needs at least ONE startEvent and ONE endEvent
- Gateways that diverge (split) should have a corresponding gateway that converges (merge)
- Task names should be verb + noun (e.g., "Review application", not "Application review")
- Use ONLY ONE pool - represent all process steps within it
- Use ONLY sequence flows - NO message flows
- Each gateway should be the sourceRef of at least 2 sequence flows or the targetRef of at least 2 sequence flows
