# Customer Support Ticket Process

## Process Flow

1. Customer submits a technical support ticket online.
2. The system assigns a ticket number and categorizes the issue.
3. If the issue is low or medium severity, assign it to Tier 1 support.
4. Tier 1 support reviews the issue and attempts initial troubleshooting.
5. If the issue is resolved, notify the customer and close the ticket.
6. If the issue is not resolved, escalate the ticket to Tier 2.
7. Tier 2 conducts deeper diagnostics and implements a solution.
8. Customer receives updates at each stage via email.
9. If the issue is critical, bypass Tier 1 and assign directly to Tier 3 support.
10. If no fix is possible, notify the customer and schedule an on-site technician.
