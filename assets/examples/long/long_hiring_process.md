# Hiring Process for an IT Position  

## Overview
This document describes the end-to-end hiring process for an IT position within a mid-sized technology company. The process involves multiple screening steps, repeated interview cycles, cross-department collaboration, and structured decision points. The hiring loop continues until a final candidate is selected and accepts the offer.

---

## 1. Role Definition and Position Kickoff
The process begins when a need for a new IT position is identified by the Engineering Department. This can happen due to team expansion, employee departure, or the introduction of new technologies requiring additional expertise.

The Engineering Manager drafts a role definition that includes required skills, experience level, certifications (if any), expected responsibilities, and the preferred starting date. Once drafted, the Engineering Manager meets with the HR Business Partner to refine the description, ensuring consistency with existing job families and compensation bands.

After finalization, HR creates the official job posting in the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). The posting is then automatically pushed to the company website, LinkedIn, and other partner job boards.

---

## 2. Application Intake and Initial Filtering
Applications arrive continuously through the ATS. HR conducts an initial screening twice a week.

### 2.1 Resume Screening
HR reviews incoming resumes and filters out candidates who clearly do not meet the basic requirements—such as lacking essential programming languages, having insufficient years of experience, or residing in a location incompatible with the job type (e.g., on-site roles).

Candidates who pass resume screening are moved to the "HR Phone Screening" stage. Those who do not pass are marked as "Not Selected," and HR triggers an automated rejection email.

---

## 3. HR Phone Screening
HR schedules a 20–30 minute phone call with each selected candidate. During the call, HR confirms salary expectations, work authorization, notice period, and basic behavioral fit.

After the call, HR enters feedback into the ATS. If the candidate does not align with compensation or work requirements, HR rejects them at this stage.

Candidates who pass the HR screening are forwarded to the Engineering Manager for technical evaluation.

---

## 4. First Technical Interview
The Engineering Manager reviews the HR notes and invites the candidate to the first technical interview. This interview typically includes:

- Discussion of previous IT experience  
- Basic technical problem-solving  
- Understanding of systems architecture  
- A small coding exercise or conceptual question  

After the interview, the Engineering Manager logs feedback. If the candidate is unsuitable, they are rejected. If promising, they advance to the next round.

---

## 5. Technical Interview Loop (Repeated Until Final Candidate Is Identified)
This is the core loop of the process.

### 5.1 Triggering Additional Interviews
If the Engineering Manager feels further evaluation is needed—or if multiple team members must assess the candidate—the manager initiates a new interview cycle. The cycle may consist of:

- A systems design interview  
- A pair-programming session  
- A DevOps or cloud proficiency interview  
- A security fundamentals assessment  
- A culture-fit discussion with senior engineers  
- An interview with a cross-functional team (e.g., Product Management, QA, or Data Engineering)

### 5.2 The Repeat Condition
After each interview cycle, the panel scores the candidate using the ATS evaluation rubric.  
If the candidate:

- Scores above the threshold → they continue to the next step  
- Scores below the threshold → they are rejected  
- Scores in an unclear middle range → **another interview cycle is scheduled**  

This loop continues until the team determines that the candidate is either a strong fit or not appropriate for the role.

The Engineering Manager ultimately decides whether the candidate passes the loop.

### 5.3 Loop Termination Criteria
The interview loop ends when:

1. **A candidate meets all evaluation criteria**, and interviewers unanimously agree to proceed, or  
2. **The candidate is rejected at any stage**.

If rejected, HR notifies the candidate and returns to the pool of applicants. The loop restarts with another candidate.

---

## 6. Final Interview with the Director of Engineering
Once a top candidate emerges from the technical loop, they are scheduled for a final interview with the Director of Engineering. This is typically a non-technical conversation focusing on:

- Long-term career alignment  
- Ability to contribute to company-wide initiatives  
- Expectations for communication and collaboration  
- Clarifying role responsibilities and growth opportunities  

The Director enters a final decision in the ATS.

If rejected, the process returns to the interview loop with the next-best candidate.

---

## 7. Offer Preparation and Approval
When the Director approves the candidate, HR prepares a compensation proposal. Finance and HR Leadership review and approve the offer package. Adjustments may occur during this phase based on internal salary bands and market calibration.

Once approved, HR generates the formal offer letter.

---

## 8. Offer Presentation and Candidate Decision
HR schedules a call with the finalist to present the offer. The candidate may request clarification or negotiation. If negotiation is required, HR and the Engineering Manager discuss possible adjustments.

Possible outcomes:

- **Candidate Accepts** → Proceed to onboarding  
- **Candidate Declines** → Return to the candidate selection loop and consider remaining applicants  

---

## 9. Pre-Onboarding and Official Hiring
If the candidate accepts:

- HR requests documentation and identity verification  
- A background check is initiated (if applicable)  
- IT prepares equipment and accounts  
- The start date is confirmed  

Once everything is completed, the hiring process ends, and onboarding begins.

---

## Summary
This hiring process is intentionally iterative. Candidates may repeat interview cycles as many times as needed until the engineering leadership reaches a clear decision. If a candidate fails or declines the offer, the process returns to the pool of applicants and continues until a final candidate is selected and accepts.
