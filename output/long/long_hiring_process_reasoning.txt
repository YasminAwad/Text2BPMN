Validation report: The process description clearly states the triggering event (identification of position need by Engineering Department) and the completion event (candidate accepts, onboarding begins). A single pool ('Technology Company') captures the whole process as described; lanes are introduced for HR, Engineering, and Offer & Onboarding to clarify role boundaries. StartEvent is 'Position Need Identified'; EndEvent is 'Hiring Complete'. All required elements (at least one StartEvent, one EndEvent, a participant/pool, and a process) are present in the description and are mapped directly to the model.
