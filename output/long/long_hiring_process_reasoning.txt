Start Event: The process description explicitly begins when a need for a new IT position is identified. This is mapped to 'Position Need Identified' as the StartEvent. End Event: The process ends when onboarding begins, i.e., after all hiring and pre-onboarding tasks are complete. This is mapped to 'Hiring Complete' as the EndEvent. Pool: The primary actor is the Technology Company; all steps are internal. Lanes: HR, Engineering, and IT Support are distinct functional roles within the process, each with at least one activity. All required BPMN elements (startEvent, endEvent, pool, activities, gateways) are represented and mapped directly from process steps and conditions in the provided description.
