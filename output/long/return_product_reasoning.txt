Validation report: The process description clearly states the trigger (customer initiates return = StartEvent 'Initiate Return'), the main participant (E-Commerce Company, representing all departments), and at least one completion event for each outcome (returns rejected due to time window, category, support, inspection, or abandonment, and successful completion). All required BPMN elements (StartEvent, EndEvent, participant/pool, process steps) were present or directly implied by the description and mapped to BPMN elements. Lanes were divided according to roles described: Customer, Automated System, Support Team, Warehouse, Finance/Refund Engine, and Closure. Gateways were created for all decision points. Intermediate events (timer, message) handle waiting and notification states. Exceptional terminations (rejected returns) are handled by specific EndEvents.
