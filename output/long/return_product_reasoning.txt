Required elements are present. The process description explicitly provides a clear start event (customer initiates the return) and completion events (return completed, rejected, abandoned, or after inspection). The main actor is the E-commerce Company, with roles Customer, System, Support Agent, and Warehouse, each corresponding to lanes. At least one startEvent and multiple endEvents are included to cover all possible closure outcomes described (rejected, completed, abandoned, inspection reject). Decision points are modeled as exclusive gateways for eligibility, restrictions, manual review, inspection outcomes, refund/exchange selection, and stock availability. All process steps are within a single pool, with sequence flows connecting all elements as per the business description.
