The process has one StartEvent ('Order Received') and two EndEvents ('Order Completed' for successful orders and 'Order Failed' for out-of-stock cases), which cover the required process boundaries. The main actor (Company) is used as the pool, as the Company is responsible for all order handling steps. There is one lane ('Order Processing'), since no distinct sub-roles are mentioned. The process description did not explicitly state the events; I inferred the start as 'Order Received' and created two ends for both possible process outcomes. All other steps (check stock, fulfill order, notify out-of-stock) were derived directly from the description.
