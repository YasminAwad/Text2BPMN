The process description does not explicitly state the start event, end event, participant, or process name. I inferred the start event as 'Receive order' and the end events as 'Order completed' (for successful completion) and 'Order failed' (for out-of-stock scenario). The pool is set as 'Company' since the company handles online orders. The process name is 'Handle Online Orders'. All required elements are present in the structured model.
