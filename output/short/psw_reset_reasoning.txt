The process description did not explicitly state the triggering event (start) or specific end event(s), so I created 'Request password reset' as the start event, and 'Password reset complete' and 'Manual reset complete' as end events to match the completion points for both automated and IT support-assisted paths. The pool represents all process participants (user and IT support) and is divided into two lanes. All required elements (startEvent, endEvent, participant, process) are present based on this interpretation.
