The process description did not explicitly state start or end events, a pool, or lanes, but implied them through user and IT support actions. Start event ('Initiate Password Reset') was inferred as the user begins the process. Two end events were created: 'Reset Completed' for successful automated resets, and 'Manual Reset Completed' for IT support intervention. The single pool represents the overall process involving both user and IT support, with lanes for 'User' and 'IT Support' to clarify roles. All required elements (at least one startEvent, one endEvent, pool, process) are present in this model.
