The process description specifies the start (contract signing) and end (completion of onboarding) events, as well as the main actor (HR/Company). These have been represented as a StartEvent ('Contract Signed'), an EndEvent ('Onboarding Complete'), and a single pool for the HR Department. Lanes were created to represent distinct roles involved (HR Specialist, IT Support, Training Coordinator), each with their respective tasks. All required elements—one StartEvent, one EndEvent, one participant (pool), and one process—are present and explicitly derived from the process description.
