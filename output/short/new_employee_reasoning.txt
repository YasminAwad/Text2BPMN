Process description did not explicitly name StartEvent or EndEvent, but the natural process boundary is 'contract signing' (start) and end of first week onboarding (end). The main actor is HR Department; only one lane (HR Specialist) was necessary since all tasks are HR responsibilities. All required BPMN elements are included: one StartEvent, one EndEvent, at least one participant, and a clearly defined process.
