The process description did not explicitly state start or end events, a participant, or lanes, but it implied a customer actor and outlined a process from initiating a return to completion. I created 'Initiate return' as the start event and two end events ('Return completed' and 'Return rejected'). All steps were assigned to a single lane for the customer. An exclusive gateway was added for the decision point regarding acceptance of the return. All required BPMN elements (start event, end event, participant/pool, process) are present.
