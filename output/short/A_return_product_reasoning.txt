The process description does not explicitly state the start or end events, participants, or process boundaries. Therefore, I defined the start event as 'Initiate Return' (when the customer decides to return a product) and the end events as either 'Return completed' (process finished successfully) or 'Return rejected' (request rejected). The participant is the Customer, as implied by the process description. The steps were identified based on a typical online return process: submitting a return request, waiting for approval, packing and sending the product, and handling approval/rejection as decision points. All required BPMN elements (start event, end events, participant/pool, process) are now present and clearly mapped.
