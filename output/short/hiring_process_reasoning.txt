Required elements identified and mapped: StartEvent ('Open IT Position'), EndEvent ('Candidate selected'), EndEvent for exception ('No suitable candidate'), participant (HR Department as single pool), and process (Hiring Process for IT Position). The process description did not explicitly mention start/end events, so they were inferred based on standard hiring process boundaries: opening a position (start) and either selecting a candidate or exhausting all options (end). The iterative interview loop is represented by gateways and sequence flows. Lanes were created for Recruiter and IT Manager to reflect typical role separation in hiring.
