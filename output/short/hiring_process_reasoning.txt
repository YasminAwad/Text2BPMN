The process description does not explicitly state the StartEvent, EndEvent, or the actor. I created 'Begin hiring process' as the StartEvent and 'Hiring complete' and 'End process (no candidates)' as EndEvents. HR Department is the primary actor/pool. The repeated interview loop is handled via gateways and sequence flows. All required BPMN elements are present and named according to the process description.
