The process description explicitly describes the main actor (Company, with Employee and Manager roles). The start event ('Requesting paid time off') is interpreted as the employee initiating the request. The end events (request approved or rejected) are inferred as the natural completion points of the process. All required elements—one pool, at least one start event, at least one end event, and a process—are present and mapped according to the process description.
