The process description did not explicitly mention a Start Event or End Event, so I created a Start Event ('Start PTO Request') and two End Events ('PTO Approved', 'PTO Rejected') to represent the process boundaries. The primary actor is the Employee (within the Company), but since a Manager is involved, I represented both with lanes in a single pool, assigning tasks accordingly. All required BPMN elements are present: at least one Start Event, two End Events (for both outcomes), one participant (pool), and a process.
