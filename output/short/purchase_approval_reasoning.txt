The description provided clear process boundaries: the process starts with the requester's submission for a new software purchase (start event), and ends either with approval or rejection (two end events). The pool is 'Company', representing the organization as the main actor. Lanes were created for 'Requester', 'Department Manager', 'Finance Team', and a final lane for process endings to organize start and end events clearly. All activities and decision points (manager approval, finance approval) were converted to tasks and exclusive gateways, respectively. Sequence flows connect each step, with conditions for decision branches. The process has at least one start event, two end events, a pool, and all required elements as per BPMN 2.0 and your instructions.
