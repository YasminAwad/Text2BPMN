The process description implied a clear start (submission of the purchase request) and two end states (approval or rejection of the purchase). I created a startEvent ('Submit purchase request') and two endEvents ('Purchase approved', 'Purchase rejected') to match these. The pool is 'Company' as it is the primary actor. Lanes are used for Requester, Department Manager, and Finance Team to reflect the roles involved. All required elements (startEvent, endEvent, pool, process) are present and correspond to the key steps and actors in the provided description.
