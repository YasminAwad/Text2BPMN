The process description did not explicitly state start and end events, a participant, or a process name. The start event was inferred as 'Initiate Return' (when the customer starts the return), and end events were inferred as 'Refund completed' (successful return and refund) and 'Return rejected' (if return not accepted). The single participant is the customer, as all actions described are from their perspective. The required elements (at least one start event, one end event, a participant, and a process) are present through this reasoning.
