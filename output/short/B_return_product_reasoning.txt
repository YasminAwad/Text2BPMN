The process description did not explicitly state the start or end events, nor did it specify a participant or process name. I interpreted the trigger as the customer initiating a return and the completion as either the refund being processed (successful end) or the return failing (unsuccessful end). The participant (pool) is the Customer, as the process describes their actions. The steps (request return, pack, ship, refund) are all tasks in a single lane. A decision point (gateway) is added for 'Product Received?' to handle the condition for refunding or failing the return. All required BPMN elements are included according to the instructions.
