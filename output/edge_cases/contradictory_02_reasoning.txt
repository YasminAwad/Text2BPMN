Required elements are not explicitly stated in the process description. The process description implies a customer complaint triggers the workflow (start event: 'Receive Complaint') and that resolution within 24 hours is required (end event: 'Complaint Resolved'). A second end event ('Time Exceeded') is added to handle the case where resolution is not achieved within 24 hours. All process activities are executed by a Service Agent, so only one lane is defined. A gateway checks if the complaint was resolved within the allowed time. No message flows or subprocesses are required. The process fits the rules: one pool, at least one start and end event, use of gateways for decision logic, and all tasks are action-based.
