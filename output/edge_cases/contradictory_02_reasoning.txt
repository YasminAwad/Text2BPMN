Required elements are present: StartEvent ('Complaint received'), EndEvent ('Complaint resolved'), participant ('Customer Service Department'), and process ('Customer Complaint Resolution Process') are all stated in the process description. To comply with the explicit rules ('cannot be processed the same day' and 'must be resolved within 24 hours'), an exclusive gateway and timer intermediate event were added to enforce waiting until the next day, and a gateway was used to check the 24-hour resolution limit. Error end event covers the exceptional case of missing the deadline.
