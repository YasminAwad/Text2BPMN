The process description did not explicitly state start events, end events, or a main participant, so I identified 'Issue detected' as the triggering StartEvent and 'Issue resolved' as the completion EndEvent. The primary actor is the Operations Team, and all activities can be represented within a single lane for a Team Member. The description implied logging, investigating, resolving, implementing, escalating, and closing issues, which I modeled as tasks. Decision points such as 'Issue resolved?' and 'Further action needed?' were captured with exclusive gateways. All required BPMN elements are present.
