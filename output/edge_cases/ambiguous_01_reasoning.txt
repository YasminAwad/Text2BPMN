The process description was generic and did not specify explicit start or end events, actor, or process name. From the phrase 'issues that sometimes occur during operations,' I reasoned that the process starts when an issue is detected (startEvent), and ends either when the process is completed (issue resolved) or the issue is escalated (endEvent). The pool is named 'Operations Team' to match the description. All required BPMN elements (startEvent, endEvent, participant/pool, and process) were created based on logical inference from the description.
