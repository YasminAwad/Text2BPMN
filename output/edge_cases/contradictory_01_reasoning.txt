The process description did not state explicit start or end events, but these are necessary for a valid BPMN process. I created 'Receive request' as the start event (trigger) and 'Request processed' as the end event (completion). The main actor is the Company, with Employee and Manager roles as lanes. The description explicitly requires a decision on whether approval is needed: an exclusive gateway is used for this, with one path leading to the Manager's approval task and the other directly to completion. A merging gateway synchronizes the two paths before ending the process. All required BPMN elements are present.
