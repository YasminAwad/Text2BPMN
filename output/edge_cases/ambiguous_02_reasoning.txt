The process description did not state explicit start or end events, participant, or process name. Based on standard onboarding flows and the context ('onboarding flow for new resources'), I created a start event ('Receive hiring decision') and an end event ('Onboarding complete'). The primary actor is assumed to be the HR Department (single pool), with a single lane for the HR Specialist. Key tasks such as collecting documents, creating a profile, and scheduling orientation are included. A decision point for document completeness is added, with a loop for requesting missing documents until they are provided. The process is validated to include at least one StartEvent, one EndEvent, one Participant (pool), and one Process, as required.
