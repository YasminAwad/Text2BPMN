The process description did not explicitly state the start or end events, nor the specific actor or roles. Based on typical onboarding flows and our prior discussion, I inferred the triggering event as 'Trigger onboarding' (startEvent) and completion as either 'Onboarding complete' (endEvent) or 'Onboarding failed' (error endEvent). The pool was assigned to the HR Department, subdivided into HR Specialist and Manager lanes, as these roles commonly execute onboarding steps. Tasks and gateways were derived from standard onboarding activities: collecting information, preparing documents, assigning equipment, scheduling meetings, and checking document completion. All required BPMN elements are present.
