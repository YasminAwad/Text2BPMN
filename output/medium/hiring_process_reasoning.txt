The process description clearly defines a single process (software engineer application) and the main participant (the company). The triggering event is the candidate submitting the application (start event: 'Receive application'). The process ends when the application is closed, either after rejection or after the final notification (end event: 'Close application'). All required BPMN elements are present: at least one start event, one end event, a single pool, and clearly defined process steps. Lanes were created for System, HR, Engineering, CTO, and Application Management to map roles and their tasks. Gateways are used for decisions at completeness check, HR approval, interview result, and assessment result. Each gateway has at least two outgoing flows, and every rejection path leads to notification and process end.
