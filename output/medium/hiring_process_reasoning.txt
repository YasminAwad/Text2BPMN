Required elements are present in the process description: the triggering event is 'Candidate submits an online application' (mapped to StartEvent 'Submit application'), and the completion events are 'notify them and close the application' (mapped to EndEvent 'Close application'). The primary actor is the Company (represented as a single pool), and the process steps are mapped to tasks, gateways, and events as per the description. Lanes are defined for System, HR, Engineering Team, and CTO, reflecting their distinct roles in the process flow. Sequence flows connect all elements according to the described process logic.
