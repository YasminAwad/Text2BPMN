The process description clearly starts with 'Customer places an online order' (startEvent) and ends either when the order is complete (customer receives tracking number) or when the process is terminated due to payment failure or backorder offer (endEvents). The single pool represents the Order Fulfillment System, which executes all process steps, including interactions with both the customer and warehouse. Lanes are used to reflect internal roles: Order Processing, Warehouse, and Customer. All required BPMN elements are present: one startEvent, three endEvents, gateways for decision points, and sequence flows connecting all elements. Task names have been converted to verb-noun format. Gateways represent 'Payment approved?' and 'Items in stock?' decisions as exclusiveGateway (XOR) nodes.
