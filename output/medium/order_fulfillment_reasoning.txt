The process description states the triggering event as 'Customer places an online order for products,' which is represented as the Start Event 'Order Received.' Completion events are: successful shipment and notification to the customer (endEvent_order_completed_1), order backordered (endEvent_out_of_stock_1), and payment failure (endEvent_payment_failed_1). The primary actor is the company, with Sales System and Warehouse as internal roles, thus two lanes are used. All tasks, gateways, and flows are derived directly from the description, and all required BPMN elements are present.
