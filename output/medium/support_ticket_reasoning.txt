The process description clearly states the triggering event: 'Customer submits a technical support ticket online', which is mapped to the StartEvent (Submit support ticket). It also states the completion event: 'close the ticket' or 'schedule an on-site technician and notify customer', both resulting in the EndEvent (Ticket closed). The single pool represents the Customer Support Team, subdivided into lanes (System, Tier 1 Support, Tier 2 Support, Tier 3 Support, Closure) for clarity, as the process flow involves different roles within the same support structure. All required BPMN elements (at least one StartEvent, one EndEvent, one participant/pool, and a process) are explicitly stated or directly inferred from the process description.
