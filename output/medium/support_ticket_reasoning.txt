Start event ('Customer submits a technical support ticket online') and end event ('notify the customer and close the ticket' or 'schedule an on-site technician') are both stated in the process description. The pool (Support Team) is inferred as the main actor handling the ticket within the company. Lanes are derived from the distinct roles mentioned (System, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Customer Notification), with each lane containing at least one task. All activities and gateways directly reflect the process steps and decisions described. No message flows are used, all notifications are represented as tasks. Required elements are all present and mapped to their natural language counterparts.
